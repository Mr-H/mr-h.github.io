      <h1>About Object Class</h1>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>"We exist to challenge the status quo. In a market where entry-level talent is overlooked and offshore contracts dominate, we deliver on-shore remote professional services that combine agility, quality, and cost competitiveness. This isn’t compromise—it’s strategy. By building experience and credibility here at home, we’re laying the foundation for our ultimate vision: an indie game studio with broad appeal, fueled by creativity and sustained by resilience. This was the only way forward, and we’re committed to making it count."</p>
      <h2>Founder’s Story</h2> 
      <p>After earning a Computer Science degree, the expectation was clear: step into a thriving tech career. Instead, the reality was sobering. Organizations reduced hiring, limiting opportunities to backfill roles with seasoned professionals. Artificial intelligence reshaped the market, accelerating productivity but shrinking entry-level demand—even though new graduates were often the most fluent in AI-driven workflows. </p>
      <p>Rather than accept a less-than-desirable alternative, this graduate chose to rewrite the rules. Offshore contract positions remained in demand, but instead of competing passively, I launched this onshore remote professional services business. The model undercuts offshore competitors while offering clients the benefit of U.S. based expertise, commitment, and accountability. Every project builds experience, every contract strengthens credibility, and every dollar earned fuels the larger dream: bootstrapping an indie game company with broad appeal. This wasn’t just a workaround—it was the only way to transform constraint into opportunity, and to ensure that passion and persistence lead to something extraordinary. </p>
